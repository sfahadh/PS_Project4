# Pokemon SetInterval

This website uses the set interval function with a trippy Pokemon theme

## About the Website

This website consists of just a single page with a gif of pickachu in the background. There is a center image of two pokemons smoking pot and a pokeball on the top left of the picture. Using the setInterval function, the pokeball will move to each corner of the image. For each time a pokeball reaches the corner of the image, another pokeball appears. This will repeat until there is a total of 4 pokeballs on the image. Also as each pokeballs reaches each corner, the opacity of the image changes. At one point, the opacity is set to 0, which will make the image completely transparent. 

There are 2 buttons below the image, one to start the setInterval function, and the other is to pause.
